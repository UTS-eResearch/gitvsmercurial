# Git versus Mercurial

## Developers

* Moises Sacal Bonequi
* Mike Lake

## Mercurial
Pros:
- Is prefered for small team
- Has access to change the version history
- Easier to use, better command line syntax
Cons:
- Not as popular

## Git
Pros:
- â€¦
Cons:
- Merge conflict
- Amending commits in remote repo
- CLI outputs sometimes are a bit hard to use, for instance, git log's output is quite ugly
- Merges sometimes will produce conflicts that are time-consuming but its resolution is trivial if you consider the history of changes.
- cannot version binary files?
- Difficult!
